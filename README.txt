Webpack Configuration for Multi-Frontend-Framework Monorepos

October 2023

Summary
   Applications can evolve from being a static websites to being more 
   dynamic, interactive and reactive. And some teams can choose to group
   their apps into a monorepo. This isn't a problem when a single
   frontend framework is used (therefore the build system is simple).
   However some teams may decide to use multiple frameworks for
   for their apps. This could be due to a functional requirement that it
   provided or perhaps the team is deciding to gradually transition into
   another frontend framework. As such, the monorepo's build system is
   required to handle multiple frameworks which unfortunately in the
   current JavaScript landscape, is a nightmare. This repo aims to show
   an example of a "Multi-Frontend-Framework Build System" capable
   of building React, Vue, and native JavaScript apps using Webpack.
